# Category Test Post

This is a test post placed in a category subfolder. Let's see if it can be processed correctly!

## Testing Folder Structure

The ability to organize posts in subfolders by category makes it easier to manage a large number of blog posts.

## Code Example

```javascript
function testCategory() {
  console.log("This post is in a category subfolder!");
}

testCategory();
```

## Conclusion

If this post can be validated and published correctly, then we've successfully implemented support for category subfolders!

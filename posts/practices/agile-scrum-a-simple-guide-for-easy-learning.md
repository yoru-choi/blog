# 🛠️ Agile Scrum - A Simple Guide for Easy Learning

## This guide has been prepared to support junior and mid-level developers in gaining a clear understanding of the Agile Scrum process, particularly in the context of collaborative team environments.

## 📋 What is Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile framework used to manage and complete complex projects. It emphasizes iterative progress, collaboration, and adaptability. The goal is to deliver a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint (a short, time-boxed period).

## 🔄 Scrum Workflow

![Scrum Workflow](https://qlqjs674.notion.site/image/attachment%3A18ab098e-eb11-4b3f-a64b-7b322b59be00%3Aagile_scrum-scrumWorkFlowForImage.png?table=block&id=1cf930ff-582f-8000-abe7-c07bb81399f0&spaceId=6ab3efe6-44b5-4e5c-9d86-56543fb7f59d&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)

The Scrum workflow typically follows these steps, which are repeated in cycles (sprints) lasting 1-2 weeks:

1. **Product Backlog**  
   A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes maintained by the Product Owner.
   If you don't know what to do, just create backlog own your self and than ask your manager.

2. **Sprint Planning**  
   The team selects items from the Product Backlog to work on during the sprint. These items are added to the Sprint Backlog.

3. **Sprint Backlog**  
   A list of tasks the team commits to completing during the sprint.

4. **Sprint Execution**  
   The team works on the tasks in the Sprint Backlog. Daily Scrum meetings are held to ensure progress and address blockers.

5. **Potential Product Increment**  
   At the end of the sprint, the team delivers a potentially shippable product increment.

6. **Sprint Review**  
   The team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders and gathers feedback.

## 🆚 Scrum vs. Traditional Waterfall

![Scrum Workflow](https://qlqjs674.notion.site/image/attachment%3Ae964a013-c249-456c-829f-c27166e2cc48%3Aimage.png?table=block&id=1fb930ff-582f-80a3-93af-d0d1535ab3ef&spaceId=6ab3efe6-44b5-4e5c-9d86-56543fb7f59d&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)

waterfall is not bad but its too hard change the plan
if you wanna agile move your project we can use scrum working process

1. **Waterfall**

   - Projects are planned in sequential phases (e.g., requirements, design, development, testing).
   - Each phase can take 3-6 months or more.
   - Changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is completed.

2. **Scrum**
   - Work is divided into short sprints (1-4 weeks).
   - Continuous feedback and adaptability are key.
   - Changes can be incorporated at the start of each sprint.

## 🧪 Solo Scrum – Practical Workflow Example

If you're working alone or with a small team but still want to practice Scrum principles:

1. Define a clear goal Set a tangible and achievable sprint objective (e.g., "Build MVP login system").
2. Create a backlog Break the goal down into actionable tasks and list them in your product backlog.
3. Estimate story points Assign story points to each backlog item based on complexity or effort.
4. Run the sprint & log your retrospective Execute the sprint, track progress daily, and write a brief sprint retrospective at the end.
5. Repeat the cycle Reflect, adjust, and start the next sprint with improvements in mind.

By following the Scrum process, teams can deliver high-quality products faster, adapt to changing requirements, and maintain better collaboration between stakeholders and developers.

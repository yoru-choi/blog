I've always been naturally curious.

Whether it's trying a new restaurant or exploring unfamiliar neighborhoods, I'm drawn to discovering new places. When I find something good, I use to post it on Instagram and revisit it when the craving hits. That same curiosity shows up in my professional life.

When a new technology emerges, I explore it. If it proves valuable, I'll integrate it into my workflow and document the experience. I'm curious by nature, but I also don't want to forget what works.

I started my career as a developer in 2020, and I've been consistently documenting my journey ever since.

I chose this platform primarily because it streamlines markdown-based deployment through token authentication.

For about four years, I used a Korean blogging platform called Tistory. When they dramatically overhauled their advertising policies, I started considering alternatives. The migration process highlighted a critical problem: I'd created all my content directly within their ecosystem.

I realized I needed a different approach. Now I manage version control through GitHub, host images on Notion (just linking to them as needed), and deploy using platform-specific tokens. This gives me the flexibility I was missing.

I experimented with several platforms during the transition. Blogger felt cumbersome. Medium presented challenges with markdown support, and their token system is essentially deprecated at this point.

After weighing my options, keeping my content on GitHub made the most sense. Platform dependency creates unnecessary friction that I'd rather avoid.

That's what led me to gradually deploy my content to dev.to.

One reason I write is to reinforce my own understanding. I could certainly rely solely on AI for quick answers—and I do, regularly. AI is remarkably powerful and will continue providing instant solutions. But I'm concerned that without the deliberate process of writing things down, less knowledge actually sticks.

Why write in English? It's straightforward. As a developer , I believe that as AI capabilities expand, human communication becomes increasingly critical—for several reasons.

There's no shortage of technically skilled developers. With personal growth and AI assistance, experienced professionals are accelerating their learning curves significantly. Even in my own work, I'm spending far less time debugging or searching documentation.

But my role fundamentally involves translating someone's vision into functional software. For that, effective communication and strong working relationships are essential. Those interactions are considerably easier when language barriers don't get in the way.

I'm Korean, currently living in Japan, but I deliberately maintain my English fluency. That's the strategy.

The tech industry will continue evolving rapidly, so thinking long-term is essential.

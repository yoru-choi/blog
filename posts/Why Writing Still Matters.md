## About Curiosity

I've always been naturally curious.

Whether it’s trying a new restaurant or exploring unfamiliar neighborhoods, I’m drawn to discovering new places. I usually look for spots with high ratings and solid reviews first. When I find a gem, I post it on Instagram and revisit it whenever the craving hits.

That same curiosity carries over into my professional life. When a new technology emerges, I explore it—especially those developed by reputable institutions or adopted by industry leaders. If it proves valuable, I integrate it into my workflow and document the entire experience. I'm curious by nature, but I also don't want to forget what works.

## My Journey

I started my career as a developer in 2020 and have been consistently documenting my journey ever since. I chose this platform primarily because it streamlines markdown-based deployment through token authentication.

## Platform Migration: From Tistory to GitHub

For about four years, I used a Korean blogging platform called Tistory. When they dramatically overhauled their advertising policies, I started considering alternatives. The migration process highlighted a critical problem: **I'd created all my content directly within their ecosystem.**

I realized I needed a different approach:
- Manage version control through **GitHub**
- Host images on **Notion** (just linking to them as needed)
- Deploy using platform-specific tokens

This gives me the flexibility I was missing.

### Testing Other Platforms

I experimented with several platforms during the transition:
- **Blogger**: Felt cumbersome
- **Medium**: Challenges with markdown support, token system essentially deprecated

After weighing my options, keeping my content on GitHub made the most sense. Platform dependency creates unnecessary friction that I'd rather avoid, which is what led me to gradually deploy my content to **dev.to**.

## Why I Write

One reason I write is to reinforce my own understanding. I could certainly rely solely on AI for quick answers—and I do, regularly. AI is remarkably powerful and will continue providing instant solutions. But I'm concerned that without the deliberate process of writing things down, less knowledge actually sticks.

## Why English?

It’s straightforward.

I work as both a developer and, at times, a project-oriented problem solver. As AI capabilities continue to advance, I believe human-to-human communication—especially verbal communication—will become even more important, not less.

There are several reasons for this. For example,  While I don't claim to fully represent his views, this is a conclusion I had already reached through my own experience using tools like GPT. It's also a topic that comes up frequently in conversations with other developers around me.

As AI improves, the cost and effort of implementation are decreasing. Development work itself is becoming faster, and learning curves are shortening thanks to both personal growth and AI assistance. In my own case, I spend far less time debugging or searching through official documentation than I used to. At the same time, a different kind of work is becoming more prominent: deciding what to build and why, through discussion and alignment between people.

Of course, engineers who can deeply understand a project and its technical constraints will always be necessary. But there is already no shortage of capable developers—and that number will only continue to grow.

My role, at its core, is to translate someone's intent and vision into working software. To do that well, I want as little friction as possible between myself and the people whose ideas I'm implementing. No matter how advanced AI becomes, we still work with people.

That's why, although I'm Korean and currently living and working in Japan, I make a deliberate effort to maintain and use English consistently. That's the strategy.

The tech industry will continue evolving rapidly, so thinking long-term is essential.

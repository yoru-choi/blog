I have studied English classes from elementary school to university, but I didn't study hard to learn English.

i leave about one year in Deajeon
It was just a class for me, so I didn't put in much effort. However, after I graduated, I hoped to speak English well. That's the reason I started to learn English seriously. It was also influenced by what I learned from studying Japanese.

At first, I didn't know where to start, so I just began learning English at a nearby school.

I learned for about one year at that Chris english school , but no name chirs when i learn thier, where they taught lessons and had us repeat.

I guess it was a very nice class because I didn't know how I could speak English before. I remember learning for about 1 year starting around February 2021.

So I moved to another job for better programming skills, because I worked in a rural place where I couldn't get much time in a good coding environment.

I started to work in the capital city, and then I started to find an English school when I was settling into this place. And then I wanted to test my English skill, so I went to a bar to meet foreigners.

And then I realized my English skill was very low - it was terrible, I guess.

I met an Asian Canadian in a bar. He asked me, "Why do you want to learn English?" I answered that it was because if I speak English, it would look very cool. That's my motivation. He taught me the sentence "What brings you to Korea?" and then I went to some women in the bar to talk and used that sentence. I usually use that sentence now. At that time, I could feel my speaking level.

So I went to an English school and applied for a class called "Kim's Speak English" at YBM, because I felt that using English to speak was more important.
I studied for about 6 months.

After I moved to Japan because i want to work abrod for my goal

after about 1 year, I felt the desire to learn English when I was speaking in Japanese. 
First, I found 6 English schools and I chose Nova English School.
Second, I install duolingo for motivation because this apply have to study everyday for daily stack

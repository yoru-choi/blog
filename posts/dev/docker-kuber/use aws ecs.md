she blow up


aws ecs fageate and ecs exist 

when i see aws repost based on the cost analysis of ecs deplokyment option

ecs on ec2 is generally much cheaper than fargate.
Fargate would be more expensive since it charges separately for vCPU and memory usage, while EC2 offers combined resource pricing.


and fination change when i run docker image kotlin serve we need spring boot profile 
so we wrote env profile on task definition 


ucrain 
that is bargen

Given 3 positives numbers a, b, c. 
make ( a OR b == c ) and return minimum flips count


sample
int a = 2;  // binary: 010
int b = 6;  // binary: 110
int c = 5;  // binary: 101


I'm gonna find minimum flip count by 2 step
step
1. find diffence point  
(a | b)^c  is we should find differnce number on bit. we have to fit a OR b == c
so

given a, b do OR operation -> 010 OR 110 = 110 
and do XOR operation with c ->  110 ^ 101 = 11
this case is can find to have to flip number except case a and b both 1

and a and b have both 1
if i do (a&b) i can find both 1 because only rest duplicate 1
and than if 


```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
    int differnce = (a | b) ^ c;
    int bothOne =   (a & b) & (~c);
    return Integer.bitCount(differnce)+Integer.bitCount(bothOne);
   }
}
```
